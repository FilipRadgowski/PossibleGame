Hello! and welcome to this very easy and relatively easy tutorial on mapmaking in "Possible Game" (Patent pending)

In order to make or edit a map in "Possible Game" (Patent pending) you need basic HTML and CSS skills, and some common sense.

===== START =====

Open up index.html file. There, find a section creatively labeled 'THE MAP'
You can edit this section in order to put together a map for "Possible Game" (Patent pending)

===== OBJECTS =====

You can use a multitude of different objects in order to create your map, such as:

Goals - The main objectives of "Possible Game" (Patent pending).            CSS Class: 'goal'
Enemies - The main antagonists of "Possible Game" (Patent pending).         CSS Class: 'enemy'
Walls - Just walls. That's it.                                              CSS Class: 'wall'

To add an object to your map, create a div tag. Then, to make a specific type of object, add the correct CSS Class to the div tag.

While creating a wall, you also need to add either a 'vertical' or 'horizontal' class to the tag. Otherwise, the wall won't show up properly on the map.

To finish creating an object, you need to add the 'actors' tag. This tag links the object to the logic of "Possible Game" (Patent pending).

Aditionally, you can also customise the objects by adding text to the div tag.

===== MODIFIERS =====

Default movement of an enemy is vertical - meaning up and down.
If you wish to change it to horizontal movement all you have to do is add a 'horizontalMovement' CSS class to the div tag.

===== PLACEMENT =====

To move your object around the map, add a proper id to its div tag.

Next, locate and open the placement.css file.

There, add your object's id and move it around by editing its 'left' and 'top' properties.

You can also edit dimesions of your objects by editing the 'width' and 'height' properties.

===== THE PLAYER =====

If you want to move the player around, you can do so in the placement.css file, similarly to moving around other objects.

===== WHAT NOT TO DO =====

Do not mess around the script.js or style.css file (unless you know what you're doing). Doing so might result in complete destruction of your copy of "Possible Game" (Patent pending).

Do not edit parts of index.html file other than 'THE MAP'.

===== EXAMPLES =====

Here are some examples of properly created objects.

Enemy:

<div class="enemy actors" id="enemy0">
    grr
</div>

Goal:

<div class="goal actors" id="goal0">
    goal
</div>

Wall:

<div class="vertical wall actors" id="wall0"></div>

===== END =====

That's it! Now you can go and create your own map for "Possible Game" (Patent pending).

Thank you for reading this tutorial and playing "Possible Game" (Patent pending)!
